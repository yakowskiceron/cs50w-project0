            For over a hundred years the Eiffel Tower has been synonymous with Paris, its silhouette instantly reconizable throughout 
            the world. Visible far and wide throrughout the city, it soars above the River Seine, opposite the Trocadero Palace by the Pont d'Iéna.
            Its slender grace and strength combine in a symbol of the achievements of the industrial age - a daring demonstration of the skills and 
            ambitions of engineers and designers in the late 19th century.

            Building techniques and materials accelerated the pace of change in the 19th century, and the challenge preoccupying many engineers-and 
            politicians- of the day was to build a structure over 300 m (1000 ft) high. French engineer Gustave Eiffel (1832-1923) 
            and his company produced plans for such a tower at the end of 1884 – largely the work of Eiffel’s head of research, 
            Maurice Koechlin. When a competition was announced two years later for schemes suitable for 1889 Paris Exposition, 
            over 100 schemes was submitted, but it was Eiffel who was chosen to create the world’s tallest structure. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Eiffel had built a number of railroad bridges and had a reputation for solving the most technically challenging problems. He was unusual
             among his peers for his reliance on calculation and precision, and his understanding of environmental stresses such as windforce ked to
              the ingenious use of filigree iron, reducing the surface area to a minimum.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over 18,000 separate components were used in the construction of the tower, many of the prefabricated and produced with the aid of detailed
             technical drawing. The tallest tower in the world was built by a team of around 250 men at a speed that still seems phenomenal, just in 26
              months. This rapid construction was possible only because of Eiffel’s ability to plan ahead with the utmost precision. The 16 piers on which
               the tower stands (four of each leg of the base) incorporated hydraulic jacks to allow for exact alignment when the first platform came to be
                built. Only very minor adjustment was necessary, but without this facility it might never have been possible to complete the building.

        <h3>The Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire estructure weighs about 10,668 tonnes (11,760 tons) and contains 2.5 million rivets</li>
            <li>The base of the tower encloses an area of 1.6ha (4 acres)</li>
            <li>About three million visitors go up the tower every year</li>
            <li>There are 1.665 steps to the top of the tower. Visitors now take an elevator from the second floor</li>
        </ul>
