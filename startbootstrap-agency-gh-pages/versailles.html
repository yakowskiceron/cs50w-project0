            <p>Versailles' gardens were designed to house a wealth of sculpture. The Water Parterre, in front of the Hall of Mirrors, has two lakes, each with four statues representing rivers of France.
                The Loire and Loiret are by Regnaudin, the Saône and the Rhône are by Tuby, the rivers Marne and Seine are by Le Hangre, and the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers are by Coysevox.

        <p>Versailles, lest that 24km (15 miles) from Paris, was chosen by King Louis XIII (1604-43) as the site for a modest chateau that would serve him as a base for
           his hunting expeditions. His son, Louis XIV (1638-1715), also enjoyed hunting but had more elaborated plans for the estate. Dissatisfied with
            other palaces available (including the Louvre and the Tuileres), he decided, in 1660, to turn Versalle into a vast royal enclave. Everything was to be the ultimate in magnificense,
            and he would build on such a scale that  eventually the whole French court could be accommodated.

        </p>

        <p>
            Work began in 1661, and in the course of two years Louis XIV, who came to be known as the Sun King, spent a vast amount of money,
            provoking anguished protests from the treasury. In fact, building was to continue for decadess, involving many thousands of workmen and ever-increasing 
            succeded by Jules Hardouin Mansart, who worked on Versailles for 30 years. André le Nôtre was responsible for the landscaping, and his grand design for the gardnes 
            so surpassed the original chateau that it was decided to turn it onto a far more sumptuous palace.
        </p>

        <h2>Very Royal Reflections</h2>

        <p>At the heart of the building is the Hall of Mirrors, a huge gallery with 17 windows overlooking the gardens, matched by enormous mirrors on the opposite wall.
            Paintings by Charles Le Brun present a flattering acount of the reign of Louis XIV between 1661 and 1678; this artistic celebration of the king helped to enhance the aura 
            of royalty that Louis was determinated to cultivate.

            The Versailles became hits permanent residence in 1682, and the French court was soon established there. Complex observed. Hopeful courtiers would come to Versailles and wait, sometimes
            in vain, for an opportunity to witness the king's Levée or Coucher - the rising or retiring to bed.

        <p>
            Louis XIV died in 1715. Louis XV (1710 - 74) engaged the architect Gabriel to carry out further work, including the building of an opera salon and the palace known as the Petit Trianon. Under
            Louis XVI (1754 - 93) a fine library was added and his queen Marie Antoinette (1755 - 93) took over the Petit Trianon. BUt in October 1789 revolutionaries reached Versailles and the palace was invaded.
