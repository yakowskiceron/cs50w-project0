            <h3>Gravitational Pull</h3>
            <p>
                In 1564 the scientist Galileo was born in Pisa, and he said to have made use of the Leaning Tower for
                 one of his experiments, dropping objects from the top in order to demonstrate that the speed of their 
                 acceleration would be the same, regardless of weight. There is no doubt that Galileo proved this point,
                  but whether he did so from the Leaning Tower is less certain. On the other hand, it would have offered
                   and ideal setting for experiments with gravity, as it apparently defies gravity itself.

        <p>
            Pisa’s famous Leaning Tower (Torre Pendente) is actually the campanile, or bell tower, of the city’s 
            cathedral, part of a magnificent ensemble of cathedral, bell tower, baptistery and cemetery. If it stood 
            upright, its fame would probably be limited mainly to historians of art and architecture. But because it is
             structurally flawed, its image is known throughout the world. 
        </p>

        <p>
            An inscription records that the tower was begun in 1174, but as the Pisan calendar was a year in advance of
             conventional dating, the true date was 1173. The original architects, Bonnano Pisano and William of Innsbruck,
              did not live to see the work completed – the tower had no bell chamber until the second half of the 14th century.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some have suggested that the tower was always intended to lean, a daring demonstration of the skill of the 
            architects. This idea is scarcely believable, and it is much more likely that the designers knew they would 
            be building on less than a solid ground and made some allowance for this in their plans, constructing foundations
             that would tolerate a certain amount of subsidence. Seeing the tower today, and experiencing the odd disorienting 
             sensation of being pulled to one side while climbing the 294 steps, one can only marvel at the fact it still stands 
             at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Leaning Tower was built as the bell tower of Pisa’s cathedral, which was begun a hundred years earlier, following a 
            naval battle in 1063 in which the Pisans defeated the Saracens at Palermo. The style of architecture is known as Pisan
             Romanesque, and Islamic influence can once again be detected in the exterior bands of alternating red and white marble.
              There are arcades rising one above the other into the gable, and the dome over the crossing of the nave and the transepts
             was a later addition.
